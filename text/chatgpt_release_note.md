Releasing GPT-4.1 in ChatGPT for all paid users
Since its launch in the API in April, GPT-4.1 has become a favorite among developers—by popular demand, we’re making it available directly in ChatGPT. 

 
GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks. Compared to GPT-4o, it's even stronger at precise instruction following and web development tasks, and offers an alternative to OpenAI o3 and OpenAI o4-mini for simpler, everyday coding needs.

 Starting today, Plus, Pro, and Team users can access GPT-4.1 via the "more models" dropdown in the model picker. Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the coming weeks. GPT-4.1 has the same rate limits as GPT-4o for paid users. 

 

Introducing GPT-4.1 mini, replacing GPT-4o mini, in ChatGPT for all users
GPT-4.1 mini is a fast, capable, and efficient small model, delivering significant improvements compared to GPT-4o mini—in instruction-following, coding, and overall intelligence. Starting today, GPT-4.1 mini replaces GPT-4o mini in the model picker under "more models" for paid users, and will serve as the fallback model for free users once they reach their GPT-4o usage limits. Rate limits remain the same.

 

Evals for GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1 mini were originally shared in the blog post accompanying their API release. They also went through standard safety evaluations. Detailed results are available in the newly launched Safety Evaluations Hub.

Mobile UI (iOS/Android) changing on Free/Plus/Pro plans
We've removed the row of individual tool icons from the mobile composer and replaces it with the new sliders‑style icon to open the Skills menu; tapping that button opens a bottom‑sheet menu where users can choose tools like Create an image or Search the web. 


No tools are deprecated—access is simply consolidated to clear space and reduce on‑screen clutter.

 

May 1, 2025
Sunsetting Monday GPT
Launched on April 1 as a one-month surprise, our “Monday” personality (available in both voice and text) has now been sunset. We hope you enjoyed Monday's irreverent style, and we’re already working on new personalities for future use. Please stay tuned for what’s next!

 

April 29, 2025
Updates to GPT-4o
We've reverted the most recent update to GPT-4o due to issues with overly agreeable responses (sycophancy). 

 

We’re actively working on further improvements. For more details, check out our blog post explaining what happened and our initial findings, and this blog post where we expand on what we missed with sycophancy and the changes we're going to make going forward.

 

April 25, 2025
Improvements to GPT-4o
We’re making additional improvements to GPT-4o, optimizing when it saves memories and enhancing problem-solving capabilities for STEM. We’ve also made subtle changes to the way it responds, making it more proactive and better at guiding conversations toward productive outcomes. We think these updates help GPT-4o feel more intuitive and effective across a variety of tasks–we hope you agree!

 

April 16, 2025 
o3 and o4-mini in ChatGPT
Today, we’re releasing OpenAI o3 and o4-mini, the latest in our o-series of models trained to think for longer before responding. These are the smartest models we’ve released to date, representing a step change in ChatGPT's capabilities for everyone from curious users to advanced researchers. For the first time, our reasoning models can agentically use and combine every tool within ChatGPT—this includes searching the web, analyzing uploaded files and other data with Python, reasoning deeply about visual inputs, and even generating images. Critically, these models are trained to reason about when and how to use tools to produce detailed and thoughtful answers in the right output formats, typically in under a minute, to solve more complex problems. This allows them to tackle multi-faceted questions more effectively, a step toward a more agentic ChatGPT that can independently execute tasks on your behalf. The combined power of state-of-the-art reasoning with full tool access translates into significantly stronger performance across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks, setting a new standard in both intelligence and usefulness.

 

Memory with Search
ChatGPT can also use memories to inform search queries when ChatGPT searches the web using third-party search providers. Learn more about search.

 

April 15, 2025
ChatGPT Image Library
All images you create with ChatGPT are now automatically saved to a new Library in the sidebar, giving you one place to browse, revisit, and reuse your work without digging through past conversations. The Library is rolling out today on Web, iOS, and Android for Free, Plus, and Pro users (Enterprise / Edu support coming soon). For now, it displays images generated with 4o Image Generation while we backfill older creations, and you can remove an image by deleting the conversation where it was made.

 

April 10, 2025 
Sunsetting GPT‑4 in ChatGPT
Effective  April  30,  2025, GPT‑4 will be retired from ChatGPT and fully replaced by GPT‑4o.

 

GPT‑4o is our newer, natively multimodal model. In head‑to‑head evaluations it consistently surpasses GPT‑4 in writing, coding, STEM, and more. 

 

Recent upgrades have further improved GPT‑4o’s instruction following, problem solving, and conversational flow, making it a natural successor to GPT‑4. 

 

GPT-4 will still be available in the API. 

 

GPT‑4 marked a pivotal moment in ChatGPT’s evolution. We’re grateful for the breakthroughs it enabled and for the feedback that helped shape its successor. GPT‑4o builds on that foundation to deliver even greater capability, consistency, and creativity.

 

March 27, 2025 
We’ve made improvements to GPT-4o—it now feels more intuitive, creative, and collaborative, with enhanced instruction-following, smarter coding capabilities, and a clearer communication style.

Smarter problem-solving in STEM and coding:
GPT-4o has further improved its capability to tackle complex technical and coding problems. It now generates cleaner, simpler frontend code, more accurately thinks through existing code to identify necessary changes, and consistently produces coding outputs that successfully compile and run, streamlining your coding workflows.

Enhanced instruction-following and formatting accuracy:
GPT-4o is now more adept at following detailed instructions, especially for prompts containing multiple or complex requests. It improves on generating outputs according to the format requested and achieves higher accuracy in classification tasks.

“Fuzzy” improvements: 
Early testers say that the model seems to better understand the implied intent behind their prompts, especially when it comes to creative and collaborative tasks. It’s also slightly more concise and clear, using fewer markdown hierarchies and emojis for responses that are easier to read, less cluttered, and more focused. We're curious to see if our users also find this to be the case.

 

This model is now available in ChatGPT and in the API as the newest snapshot of chatgpt-4o-latest. We plan to bring these improvements to a dated model in the API in the coming weeks.

 

March 18, 2025 
We have been working on a variety of usability and performance improvements and bug fixes across Web, Android, and iOS. Below are a small number of specific callouts. For updates on the ChatGPT macOS app, please see this page.

Conversations started on your device when chat history is disabled won’t be used to improve our models, won’t appear in your history on your other devices, and will only be stored for 30 days. Similar to the functionality on the web, this setting does not sync across browsers or devices. Learn more.

Web browsing and Plugins are now rolling out in beta
If you are a ChatGPT Plus user, enjoy early access to experimental new features, which may change during development. We’ll be making these features accessible via a new beta panel in your settings, which is rolling out to all Plus users over the course of the next week.

 


Once the beta panel rolls out to you, you’ll be able to try two new features:

Web browsing: Try a new version of ChatGPT that knows when and how to browse the internet to answer questions about recent topics and events.

Plugins: Try a new version of ChatGPT that knows when and how to use third-party plugins that you enable. 

To use third-party plugins, follow these instructions:

Navigate to https://chatgpt.com/

Select “Plugins” from the model switcher

In the “Plugins” dropdown, click “Plugin Store” to install and enable new plugins

 

To enable beta features:

Click on 'Profile & Settings'

Select 'Beta features'

Toggle on the features you’d like to try

For more information on our rollout process, please check out the article here.

 

In addition to the beta panel, users can now choose to continue generating a message beyond the maximum token limit. Each continuation counts towards the message allowance.

Updates to ChatGPT
We’ve made several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:

You can now turn off chat history and export your data from the ChatGPT settings. Conversations that are started when chat history is disabled won’t be used to train and improve our models, and won’t appear in the history sidebar. 

We are deprecating the Legacy (GPT-3.5) model on May 10th. Users will be able to continue their existing conversations with this model, but new messages will use the default model.

Introducing plugins in ChatGPT

Today, we will begin extending plugin access to users and developers from our waitlist. The plugins we are rolling out with are:

Browsing: An experimental model that knows when and how to browse the internet

Code Interpreter: An experimental ChatGPT model that can use Python, and handles uploads and downloads

Third-party plugins: An experimental model that knows when and how to use external plugins.
